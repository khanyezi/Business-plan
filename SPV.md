#### Introduction
To fund the student loans we will set up an investment vehicle to to attract investors interested in participating in social responsible investing. 

Once the repayments by the stundets start, the funds received will be distributed in proportion to the investors initial investment.

#### Summary of how it will work:
1. A SPV is set up to raise funds for student loans
2. Debt type securities are issued to investors, where they can choose to buy out KhanyeziToken:
  * This will recieve the risk - free rate of return, if no defaults occure. 
  * however the investors take on all the credit risk and are paid out those funds available. 
3. These funds are then used to provide the student with loans, and paid directly to either the university 
4. The SPVâ€™s obligations to the investors is limited to and secured by a security interest created by the SPV over the loans 
5. Investors receive a return on their investment which is funded and secured by the loans acquired by the SPV
  * Students will be charged the risk-free rate plus some margin to cover costs 
  * We expect for them to be employed after they graduate to repay the capital with interest payments, once they receive an income
  * the period until repayment may be a year plus some lag period (6 months) to allow the students some extra time to find a job.
  
 #### Legal status: TBC
 
 #### Details on SPV securities:
These are usually bonds, or notes and can be issued to investors who would liek to invest into the future of their business. This investment may not guarantee high returns, however:
* the investore may be eligible to a tax break on their investment
* are diversifying their portfolio
* Taking part in social resposible investing

#### Why tokenize the tranches?
This will allow for greater liquidity for investors to trade the tokens and hence their investment on secondary markets. It will also allow a wider range of investors to invest in the student loans, large corporates or small scale investors looking to diversify their portfolio. 
Additionally, it will provide the investors will more transparency on their investment, which is a big problem in traditional SPVs. 

#### Key risks 
1. Credit risk: risk of students failing to repay loans, specifically performing worse than expected under the securitized ratings
2. Risk of short term cashflow problems: this is one of the largest challanges we will face. 
  * Timing risk: risk that the students make late payments and so mismatching of asset to liability profile of portfolio
  * Manage: by assuring that there are adequate cashflows to pay amounts due on time (maybe difficult). This will be done by having some capital reserved for cashflow mismatches
3. Interest risk: this will be faced by the investors
4. Currency risk: This will espacially be a problem as we may have to convert all funds received into ether to transfer them using the Ethereum blockchain.
